# CONTRIBUTING TO BEYOND ACTIVISMO

_Trying to understand people from different cultures, religions and countries have in common through their activism, is an amazing but difficult task.

![Web Developer Slide](https://github.com/Beyondactivismo/Beyondactivismo/blob/master/fotos/contribue-webdevelopers-small.jpg)

We are working in a Wordpress Multisite because we want to upload the content in different languages that is why we have different subdomains. Our problem is that we lack of experience and knowledge in Web development that is why we need:

 **[Ideas or Solutions to work open with Wordpress](https://github.com/Beyondactivismo/Beyondactivismo/issues/34)**   
We need ideas or solutions to work open with Wordpress. We want that our Github repositories can be easily upload in our website.  


**[Ideas or Solutions to have a secure submission zone](https://github.com/Beyondactivismo/Beyondactivismo/issues/36)**
We need to receive and review the content that our contributors send to us. That is why we need to implement a submission zone in our web page where they can upload from small to large files in a secure way.


**[Ideas or Solution to implement a Safe donation method in our Website](https://github.com/Beyondactivismo/Beyondactivismo/issues/35)**
We are thinking in different ways to get support to keep improving our project. That is why we think in this option and we want to hear about your opinion, experience and everything you have to say about it, and also if you want to help us to implement this in our website.
