# Finding a History

### 1.Does the History match BA´s values?

When looking for a History to tell, make sure that...

*Human Rights* are all thoes "inherent to all human beings, whatever our nationality, place of residence, sex, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, language, or any other status". 

*Human Rights Activism* is the constant search of a common good in this unequal world. Is the capacity to detect injustice and decide to take action on it.


a *Human Right Activist* is every person how, individually or as part of a community, fights for a common good in an independent way. Excluding people how directliy represent govermental and military organizations. 

   
### 2.Who is the person beyond it?

 Collecting this basic information can help you get to know the person better before you contact them.


            Is an activist in....

            You consider her/him an activist because...

            Where does the person activism takes place...(Location, Organization-Institution...)

            Is the person in danger? If so can you ensure a safe meeting? under which conditions?


### 3.Contact the History

   _Present the project_: you can either Use [The Intro video] or use the [Text]

   _Explain the reason why_ you believe it is important to publish her/his history.

   _How_ the material will be used

   _How long_ the interview will take.

                      
                        If you don´t receive an answer we encourage you to keep on trying. 
                        It doesn´t mean they don´t want to do it but they probably have lot 
                        of stuff on the table.  



# Historytelling Guideline

### 1.Key principles to get a Fair History

* Human Centered Research: hve a nice and respectfull conversation, create a EMPATHIC enviroment. If they tell something you see it is important for them, keep diging on that. Ask them about their fellings and thoughts. Rembember to ask what is worthfull for them to be asked.  

* Co-Working:  

* Open Source: Our project is thought as a open network of collaborators where they can work, give ideas, make improvements, take decisions, and so on. Working on such a comuity gives you the oportunity to find support any time you need. So don´t hessitate on conntact others. Ask for their opinions and clear up your doubts with other. Remember that learning from others expiriences is one of our milestones. 

### 2.Prepare yourself

   _1.Location:_ If possible do it on a place the person proposed, that will help her/him fell more comfortable.                  Also take into account your surroundings Light, which time is it better. Do you need any extra equipment (lights, reflectors,...) Can you go there before? or get any idea of how it is? Get familiar with the place,  even make a short testing?  

   _2.Person:_ Can we show the person? If not, what chances do we have to represent her/him on the video/photos?

   _3.Photo/Video:_ details or cutaways, to combine them is also an option! Is there any atmosphere location near by that can help on the video?  

   _4.Is there any Material from the person you would like to add?_ (fotos, videos,text...) Take it into account by the moment of writing your script.



### 3.History Content Guideline

WE SHOULD REVIEW SOME OF THE SUBTHEMES --> DO THEY REALLY MACH OUR GOALS? 


 **INTRODUCTION**

                                           THANK THE PERSON!!!



# Setting

_(People who do not have previous experiences.)_

_(see if we can do it in an interactive/merge way for different ‘levels’ of experience, E.g BBC cooking manual)_

E.g [Of organization](https://www.circulardesignguide.com/post/embed-feedback)



**Attitude/ Behavior:** be calm and friendly. Respect the time of others. It is not an interview to confront somebody but to understand and lend a voice to them.

**Technical setting:**

   * micro: -What about ambient noise levels? Traffic/machine noise/wind?
-is it a controlled or uncontrolled environment?
   * camera:   
      * check white balance, settings, iris etc.
        * follow composition guidelines (rule of thirds, headroom, looking space, etc)
        * no 'crossing the line'  - imagine the camera is a theatre audience, your subjects are on stage – the camera should stay in the audience and not cross to the other side of the speakers.
        * camera at eye level (or maybe slightly above)
        * subject should look at interviewer, just off camera


                                 Before starting double check everything!!!
