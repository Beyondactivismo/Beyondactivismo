BA TOOLKIT

    • a series of fact sheets that describe the structure, functions, policies of BA

    • a series of publications, each designed to help contributors accomplish interviews

Organization:
    • information that is *grouped* in categories in order to provide targeted direction to specific audiences. Make categories such as levels of involvement in program, level of competencies and/or outcomes expectations

    • information specifically *organized within* these categories to provide direction on when to read, in what order to read and how to apply (similar to pathfinders)

    • interactive content


Who for?

1_2_ For everybody who wants to upload “stories” on our page.
(see if we can do it in an interactive/merge way, For writing / dividing the ‘levels’ of experience, E.g BBC cooking manual ) 

What for?

1_ 2_ basic reading sheet of what we consider contributors should read before interviewing an Activist.

1_2_ So they can easily gain information always in the same way. So that we can easily evaluate and process. There must be based on “privacy by design”
