Hi! One of our goals is to deliver every content on our website in different languages.  
Would you please help us brake the language barrier ?

If you want to translate some of the existing language versions into a new one please feel free to do it, we will be really happy to receive your help.

You have several options:


1.- You can just copy one of the available translations and work on it, then submitt that to us via email contacto@beyondactivismo.org


2.- You can work on Github:

2.1.- Create a Github Account

2.2.- You can enter to one of the available translations and copy the text. 

2.3.. You can create a new folder with the name of the language that you will work on.

2.4.- Into the folder you can create the document with the new translation.
